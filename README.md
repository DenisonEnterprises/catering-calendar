# Denison Enterprises - Piper Project
A project integrating scheduling and catering for student use.
Objective: minimize food waste and provide service to Denison students.

Update: I talked to Claire and Nick and we're planning on moving to a LAMP stack. I will completely avoid Google Calendar and the API's garbage and pull things directly from the .ics file with PHP.
