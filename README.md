# Denison Enterprises - Piper Project
~~A project integrating scheduling and catering for student use.~~
###Update as of November 18th, 2016
Denison's food service provider, Bon Appetit, decided it would be best to not move on with this project after some management changes. It's been scrapped. 

The code filed under this repository is poorly written and incomplete. Please disregard.

Objective: minimize food waste and provide service to Denison students.
