# Denison Enterprises - Piper Project
A project integrating scheduling and catering for student use.
Objective: minimize food waste and provide service to Denison students.

Delayed due to red tape. Hopefully I will get new information before winter break and finish it then.
UPDATE: Still delayed due to stylistic questions. Hope to talk to Nick and Claire soon.
