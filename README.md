# Denison Enterprises - Piper Project
A project integrating scheduling and catering for student use.
Objective: minimize food waste and provide service to Denison students.

Update: Talked with Aaron today and we're going to try to work with Denison on authentication issues. Getting access to students' grad year and email is proving to be a lot harder than originally thought.
